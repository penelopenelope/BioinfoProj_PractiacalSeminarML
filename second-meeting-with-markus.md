## 1. What we are doing now

1. Pegah and Mahdi - VGG model

## 2. Any other endoscopy images available?

## 3. If we can use other image data?

1. limited within proximal endoscopy images?
2. if we find some available proximal endoscopy images, can we use them?

   -&gt; real-world images/ good-conditioned images
