## 1. Research Problem - Atrophic Gastritis Diagnosis

leading to a loss of [gastric glandular cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_gland) and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues

Given this information, the motivation of this research project is that the diagnosis quality from the conventional white-light endoscopy is that

so the desired situation is that we want to develop a
