# Introduction Presentation

## 1. Research Problem - Atrophic Gastritis Diagnosis

leading to a loss of [gastric glandular cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_gland) and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues

Given this information, the motivation of this research project is that the diagnosis quality from the conventional white-light endoscopy is that

so the desired situation is that we want to develop a 

## 2. Current Situation

Aiming at this desired situation, what is the current situation of the research topic? There are some methods already really successful enough and helpful to give us some intructions. 

### 1\) Guimarães, P., Keller, A., Fehlmann, T., et al.​ 

###  Deep-learning based detection of gastric precancerous conditions

the first methods is also an inspiration to our research project, which achieved a rather high accuracy even though the image data size is limited severely. 

the first dataset is used mainly for model training and the second one is for model modification and testing. They selected several deep learning methods to
